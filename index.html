        <h3>Java Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 3.5 years of experience in Java. I started learning to code by using Java in AP Computer Science A
          during junior year of high school. Funny
          story,
          but I hated coding before I took this class. However, the intricacies and satisfaction of coding drew me to
          love computer science.</p>

        <h3>Python Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 1 year of experience in Python. I learned Python during my first semester in college while taking the
          class Introduction to Computing Using
          Python. I loved the class so much that I decided to T.A. the class!</p>

        <h3>OCaml Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 0.5 years of experience in OCaml. I learned what a programming language truly is with OCaml and
          Michael Clarkson in the course Data Structures
          and Functional Programming. Though at first, OCaml seemed a little confusing, as the semester progressed, I
          fell in love with OCaml's intuitiveness.</p>

        <p>I have 1 year of experience in Swift. I learned Swift through the class iOS Development run by the AppDev
          project team at Cornell. I remember when
          I finished implementing my first app, I immeadiately called my parents and gushed about how cool it was.</p>
