        <h3>Java Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 3.5 years of experience in Java. I started learning to code by using Java in AP Computer Science A
          during junior year of high school. Funny
          story,
          but I hated coding before I took this class. However, the intricacies and satisfaction of coding drew me to
          love computer science.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="python" src="python.png" alt="python-img">
        <h3>Python Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 1 year of experience in Python. I learned Python during my first semester in college while taking the
          class Introduction to Computing Using
          Python. I loved the class so much that I decided to T.A. the class!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="ocaml" src="ocaml.svg" alt="ocaml-img">
        <h3>OCaml Programming Language</h3>
        <p>I have 0.5 years of experience in OCaml. I learned what a programming language truly is with OCaml and
          Michael Clarkson in the course Data Structures
          and Functional Programming. Though at first, OCaml seemed a little confusing, as the semester progressed, I
          fell in love with OCaml's intuitiveness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="ios" src="swift.png" alt="ios-img">
        <h3>iOS Development (Swift Programming Language)</h3>
        <p>I have 1 year of experience in Swift. I learned Swift through the class iOS Development run by the AppDev
          project team at Cornell. I remember when
          I finished implementing my first app, I immeadiately called my parents and gushed about how cool it was.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="sql" src="sql-server.png" alt="sql-img">
        <h3>Backend Development (SQL, Docker, Postman)</h3>
        <p>I have 1 year of experience in SQL. I learned Backend Development through the class Backend Development in
          which there were so many cool
          projects. In fact, for the final project, I led a group of backend developers, designers, and an android
          developer to create an app that crowdsources decision-making.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="html" src="html.png" alt="html-img">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I learned Web Development through the course The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. It was an
          excellent course that was very in depth and helped me create this very website.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="git" src="github.png" alt="github-img">
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>I have 1 year of experience in GitHub. I picked up GitHub along the way of my computer science journey. I
          remember that the first time I used
          GitHub, I could not understand how anyone would want to use it. Now, after several projects using GitHub, I
          realize its usefulness and ability to connect teams.</p>
